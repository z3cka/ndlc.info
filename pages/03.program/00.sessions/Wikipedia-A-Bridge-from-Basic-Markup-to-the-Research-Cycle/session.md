_Wikipedia is a widely-used resource for information, but there’s always room for improvement when it comes to underrepresented entry subjects, especially in academic environments. Many instructors hesitate to use Wikipedia as a trusted source, but bringing students, faculty and community members together at Wiki Edit-a-thons to understand how these pages are created and by whom (predominately white men), and then to create new pages featuring diverse or underrepresented people/subjects, is a deep dive into the research cycle. If possible, create or bring your Wikipedia log in and laptop so we can do some hands on editing. Beginners are welcome._
