_After an intensive two-year process of engagement, reflection, and discernment, the ALA Task Force on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion made recommendations for how the world largest library association can promote and support the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion within the association, the library profession, and the larger world. A panel of task force members will share their experiences of grappling with these issues, review their final recommendations, and give advice on crafting diversity plans._
