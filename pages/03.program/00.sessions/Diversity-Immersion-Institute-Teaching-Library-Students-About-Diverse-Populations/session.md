_The Diversity Immersion Institute is a program created at the University of Maryland, College Park to educate future
 librarians about diversity issues.  This seven day Institute will expose future librarians to issues of diversity 
 and inclusion via a series of activities, such as, readings, journaling, introspection, group discussions and feedback from diverse librarians of color.  The purpose of this Institute is to allow individuals who have not been exposed to diverse populations a chance to explore the myriad of diversity issues they will encounter in the workforce and in life. Future librarians will also get an opportunity to teach sessions with faculty of color and create and execute programs for students of color.  Moreover, this program will help future librarians understand how they can become advocates of issues of diversity within their professional lives. _
