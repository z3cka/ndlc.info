_This roundtable will facilitate a constructive conversation about the challenges and opportunities in our profession’s attempts to recruit and retain a diverse workforce. Panelists and audience members will discuss the issues involved, successes, and shortcomings in work at organizational, inter-institutional, and national levels. Participants will have an opportunity to learn about diversity initiatives in different contexts, discuss the merits of different approaches, and develop an understanding of what a successful program might look like in their context._
