_Panelists from Portland State University and University of Southern California will present examples of successful 
programming and outreach with Special Collections to address cultural and linguistic diversity and build community.  
They will offer perspectives of librarians, faculty and staff who effectively use local collections and primary resources for community engagement, events, exhibitions, publications and instruction.  Drawing upon the cultural and academic centrality of the library as a way to raise visibility and foster inclusivity, the panelists will illustrate the potential for Special Collections as a hub for community connections and collaborations on campus and beyond._
