_First-generation (FG) college students cannot turn to their parents for information about the college experience. Where do they go instead, and what challenges do they face? The panelists, from a small, medium-size, and large institution, explore: the needs and information literacy behaviors of FG students; a cross-campus study identifying differences between FG students and their non-FG peers in their information-seeking behaviors, library anxiety, and self-efficacy; and campus-wide and library efforts to support FG students._
