_Microaggressions are brief, commonplace indignities that continue to affect individuals from marginalized 
communities. In libraries, they can occur among and between library employees and patrons. In this roundtable 
session, we will introduce microaggressions and their impact within the library community and discuss microactivism as a proactive response to microaggressions (and macroaggressions), followed by a facilitated discussion and storytelling opportunity among participants, in which we document microaggressions on Post-its to be used for the LIS Microaggressions blog and a special NDLC zine._
